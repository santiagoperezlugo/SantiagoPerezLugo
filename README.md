## Hi there 👋
My name is Santiago and I am a third year at the University of Virginia!

- 🏀 I **recently** built [Ti-Hoops](https://github.com/santiagoperezlugo/Ti-Hoops), a model trained on 50,000 NBA games and allows users to run accurate, custom NBA game simulations  
    - Check it out here: https://www.ti-hoops.com/

- 🔭 I **previously** worked on [Vista](https://github.com/santiagoperezlugo/Vista), a recommendation model suggesting TV shows based on your viewing preferences and watch history, featuring a database of over 30,000 movies and personalized recommendation scores  
<br>

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born in Mexico and am bilingual!

- 📫 I’m currently looking for a Summer 2026 Internship.
