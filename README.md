## Hi there 👋
My name is Santiago and I am a third year at the University of Virginia!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Vista](https://github.com/santiagoperezlugo/Vista), a model that suggests TV shows based on your viewing preferences and watch history, featuring a database of over 30,000 movies and personalized recommendation scores  
<br>

- 🏀 I recently built [Ti-Hoops](https://github.com/santiagoperezlugo/Ti-Hoops), a model trained on 50,000 NBA games and allows users to run accurate, custom NBA game simulations
